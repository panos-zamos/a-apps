# deploy/.env
#
# Deployment contract for the droplet.
#
# Keep this file on the droplet (NOT committed; ignored by git). Docker Compose
# reads it automatically when you run commands from the deploy/ directory.
#
# Why these variables exist:
# - DOMAIN: used by Caddy to decide which hostname to serve and to request a
#   public ACME/Let's Encrypt certificate. If this is missing/wrong, HTTPS may
#   fail (e.g. ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR / no peer certificate).
# - REGISTRY + IMAGE_TAG: define exactly which images the droplet will pull.
# - JWT_SECRET: shared auth secret; must be stable and identical across apps.
#
# Important: the droplet should be "pull-only". Build+push happens on your
# laptop or in CI (see docs/publishing.md).

# Public hostname (must resolve to this droplet)
DOMAIN=holisticagency.com

# Docker image registry prefix (no trailing slash)
# Example (DigitalOcean): registry.digitalocean.com/<your-registry>
REGISTRY=registry.digitalocean.com/your-registry

# Image tag to deploy (must exist in the registry)
IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Required secret (generate a strong one)
#   openssl rand -hex 32
JWT_SECRET=change-me
